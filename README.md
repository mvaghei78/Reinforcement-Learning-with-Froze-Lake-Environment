# Reinforcement Learning with Frozen Lake Environment

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning project with the Frozen Lake environment! In this project, we aim to implement both the Policy Iteration and Value Iteration algorithms using the Frozen Lake environment from the Gym library. Our goal is to investigate the impact of various parameters, including gamma and different reward values, on the performance of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) model.

## Frozen Lake Environment

The Frozen Lake environment is a classic RL problem that simulates navigation on a grid-world with slippery ice patches and a goal. For more detailed information about the Frozen Lake environment, please refer to the [official documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/).

## Project Details

To dive deeper into the project's results and code, you can explore the following resources:

- **Code**: The implementation of the Policy Iteration and Value Iteration algorithms can be found in the jupyter 
  notebook file.

- **Documentation**: Detailed insights, findings, and explanations of the experiments and results are documented in the project's documentation file.
